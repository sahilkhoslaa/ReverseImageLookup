Project : Reverse Image Lookup using Python and OpenCV

Description : Our goal here is to build a personal image search engine. Given our dataset of vacation photos, we want to make this dataset “search-able” by creating a “more like this” functionality — this will be a “search by example” image search engine. For instance, if I submit a photo , our image search engine should be able to find and retrieve all similiar photos.
